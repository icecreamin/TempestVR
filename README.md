Welcome to Uvic-Virtual's VR MMO Adventure game!
This game is focused on sociolizing, adventuring and just having a general good time in VR.

Please make branches, make features, merge the branches back to master when working.

Please enjoy your stay and direct any questions to our slack channel or our leader Domenic (AKA icecreamin).
