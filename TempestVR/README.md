Welcome to Uvic-Virtual's VR MMO Adventure game!
This game is focused on sociolizing, adventuring and just having a general good time in VR.

Please make branches, make features, then call a pull request to add your feature to the master branch when working.

Please enjoy your stay and direct any questions to our slack channel or our leader Domenic (AKA icecreamin).
